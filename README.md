I'ma tell you what a bird told me

The code to your gate is 9-9-3

I'ma tell you what a bird told me

You leave your house at 10:15

Used the pic of your kitchen, found your place on Zillow

Really-really love those bright-green pillows

Chase Bank called, there's some debt that you still owe

Clean those dishes, you should use that Brillo


I'ma tell you what a bird told me
I'ma tell you what a bird told me
I'ma tell you what a bird told me
I'ma tell you what a bird told—


I'm in your house bitch, I'm in your house (Knock knock)
I'm in your house bitch, I'm in your house (Knock knock)
I'm in your house bitch, I'm in your house (Knock knock)
I'm in your housе bitch, I'm in your house (Knock knock)
